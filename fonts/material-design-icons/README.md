# Material Design Icons from Google

Since material-design-icons is more than 350 MB, we've included only the bits we need from the `iconfonts` directory from the `material-design-icons` module.

A few other files that aren't included here, because they aren't in the CSS file we use:

* codepoints
* MaterialIcons-Regular.ijmap
* MaterialIcons-Regular.svg 
* MaterialIcons-Regular.eot - we don't support IE6-8; this was removed from the CSS file too

## Original README

The recommended way to use the Material Icons font is by linking to the web font hosted on Google Fonts:

```html
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/icon?family=Material+Icons"
      rel="stylesheet">
```
